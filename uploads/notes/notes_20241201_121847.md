**Breadth-First Search (BFS) Algorithm**
=====================================

### Overview

In this lecture, we will explore the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is a graph traversal algorithm that visits all nodes at a given depth level before moving on to the next depth level.

### Key Components

*   **Queue**: A data structure used to store nodes to be visited.
*   **Root Node**: The starting node of the graph, typically represented by 0 (or any other unique identifier).

### BFS Algorithm Steps

1.  **Select Root Node**: Start at the root node (node 0).
2.  **Enqueue Neighbors**: Add all unvisited neighbors of the current node to a queue.
3.  **Dequeue Next Node**: Remove the next node from the queue and mark it as visited.
4.  **Repeat Steps 2-3**: Continue dequeuing nodes until all nodes at the current depth level have been visited.

### Example Walkthrough

*   Start at node 0 (root node).
*   Enqueue neighbors of node 0: nodes 2 and 3.
*   Dequeue next node: node 2. Mark as visited.
*   Enqueue unvisited neighbors of node 2: nodes 4 and 5.
*   Dequeue next node: node 3. Mark as visited.
*   Enqueue unvisited neighbors of node 3: none (all neighbors have been visited).
*   Dequeue next node: node 4. Mark as visited.
*   Dequeue next node: node 5. Mark as visited.

### Resulting Queue

After visiting all nodes at the first depth level, the resulting queue is:

`0 2 3 4 5`

This represents the order in which nodes were visited during the BFS traversal.
