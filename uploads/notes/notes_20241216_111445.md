**Speed, Distance, and Time**
=====================================

### Overview

Today's lecture covers the fundamental concepts of speed, distance, and time in physics.

### Formulas for Calculating Speed, Distance, and Time

*   **Speed**: Divide distance by time: `speed = distance / time`
*   **Time**: Divide distance by speed: `time = distance / speed`
*   **Distance**: Multiply speed by time: `distance = speed Ã— time`

### Relative Speed

When two objects are moving towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. When they move in opposite directions, their relative speed is the difference between their individual speeds.

*   **Relative Speed (towards each other)**: `relative_speed = speed1 + speed2`
*   **Relative Speed (opposite directions)**: `relative_speed = speed1 - speed2`

### Time to Catch Up

To find the time it takes for one object to catch up to another, we need to subtract their relative speeds and divide by the relative speed.

*   **Time to Catch Up**: `time_to_catch_up = (speed1 - speed2) / relative_speed`
